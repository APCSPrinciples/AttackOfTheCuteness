Attack Of The Cuteness
======================

We're going to work through the free tutorial [Game Development Crash Course](http://masteringcoronasdk.com/game-development-crash-course/) by J. A. Whye. Download and extract the [Attack of the Cuteness.zip file](https://github.com/APCSPrinciples/AttackOfTheCuteness/blob/master/Attack%20of%20the%20Cuteness.zip?raw=true) with all the artwork for the game. Then, choose *File | New File* and save the file as `main.lua` to the Attack of the Cuteness folder.
We're going to skip the tutorial lessons 1 - 6 since they only cover configuration and setup. We'll start with first lesson that uses Lua code, "07 Space Oddity."
