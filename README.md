Attack Of The Cuteness
======================

We're going to work through the free tutorial [Game Development Crash Course](http://masteringcoronasdk.com/game-development-crash-course/) by J. A. Whye. Download and extract the [Attack of the Cuteness.zip] file below with all the artwork for the game. Then, choose File | New File and save the file as main.lua to the Attack of the Cuteness folder.
We're going to skip lessons 1 - 6 since they only cover configuration and setup. We'll start with first lesson that uses Lua code, "07 Space Oddity."
